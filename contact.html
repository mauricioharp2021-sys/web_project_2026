                    <h3>Why this page exists</h3>
                </header>

                <p>This page is here to practice having a clear contact section on a simple site. The main goal is making the structure easy to understand through headings and paragraphs.</p>

                <p>Since GitHub Pages doesn’t process form submissions by itself, I’m not building an actual form on this site right now. Instead, I’m describing what I would include if forms were enabled.</p>

                <p>Even without a form, a contact page still matters because it gives users a clear place to look when they want to reach the site owner.</p>

                    <h2>What a form would collect</h2>
                    <h3>If a form worked on GitHub Pages</h3>
                </header>

                <p>If this site included a form, it would collect a name, an email address, and a short message. That would be enough for someone to contact me about feedback or questions.</p>

                <p>I would also include an optional dropdown for the reason for contacting me, like “class project,” “feedback,” or “collaboration,” so messages are easier to sort.</p>

                <p>A form would make sense because it gives people a direct way to communicate without leaving the site, and it keeps the contact process clear and simple.</p>
