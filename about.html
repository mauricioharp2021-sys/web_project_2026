                <p>My name is Mauricio Harp, and I’m building this website for ICT 420. The goal is to practice semantic HTML and learn how structure communicates meaning on the web.</p>

                <p>I’m treating this site like a foundation I can build on later. Even though it looks plain right now, it’s organized and consistent, which matters more at this stage than design.</p>

                <p>I’m also using this as a way to document what I learn each week. Over time, I want it to feel like a small portfolio that shows my progress and skills.</p>

                    <h3>Why semantic HTML matters</h3>
                </header>

                <p>This site is being built step-by-step using semantic HTML5 structure. That means I’m using elements like <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>article</code>, and <code>section</code> to make the layout clear.</p>

                <p>Semantic structure helps users skim and also helps assistive technologies understand what each part of the page is supposed to do. Clear headings make it easier to navigate without getting lost.</p>

                <p>Once the structure is solid, styling will be easier later because I won’t be fighting messy HTML. I’ll just be improving the look of something that already makes sense.</p>
